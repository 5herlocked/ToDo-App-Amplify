# Lighthall - Amplify

Everything that works:
- Notes:
  - Adding, deleting, changing status and adding, viewing due dates
- User:
  - Logging in, Logging out

Enjoyed:
- React
  - The ease of use, interop with JSX and flexibility in choosing methods of doing stuff
  - The overall build system and interactions with the Amplify SDK are also very transparent making it easy to understand
- Amplify
  - The amazing CLI, integration with AWS services and ease of configuration when compared to other offerings (Firebase, Azure, etc.)

Did Not enjoy:
- CSS
  - It felt very finicky and most of the time it was just trial and error to get something right
  - Probably also just a time thing
- GraphQL
  - This is a time thing, still a little fuzzy on queries and resolvers and some of the more advanced GraphQL topics
  - Appreciate the fact that it's all converted to strings when comparing because (although inefficient) allows for some cheating
